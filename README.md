## 🏡 Welcome to Marvelous Mansions - A one stop shop to your dream property!

The estate agents 'Marvelous Mansions' recently lost their lead developer half way through their new website design - which has left them in a 'realestate'! 😱


## The Task

Your mission is to rapidly help Marvelous Mansions get their website looking as good as possible using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- You will need to add Tailwind to the project, use this installation guide to help you (note: you can skip step 1):
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

- Utility class cheat sheet here: https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/

- You can add the VSCode extension `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense` for autocomplete and Tailwind support


## Getting Started

👉 fork & clone this repository

👉 npm install 

👉 npm run dev


## Tips & Tricks

- You will not need to create any CSS files for this task - yay! 🎉

- Create new components wherever you see fit! E.g. in `card.tsx` it would make sense to create separate components for the different elements in there, such as a heading component, an image component etc so feel free!

- Bonus points if you can make the page responsive

- Don't forget to check the docs!
